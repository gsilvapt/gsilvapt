:robot: Tech stuff:

- Software Developer with a focus on cyber security. Working now as an AppSec Engineer, mostly building tools, CLIs and automation to secure the software development lifecycle.
 
- Occasional security researcher, eternal reverse engineering learner.
  
- Python and Go _connoisseur_. I try to pick the best tool for the trade.
  
- Passionate and contributor of open source software.
  
- Sometimes I share my thoughts and experiences in [my website](https://gsilvapt.me) but I don't do it as often as I should!
