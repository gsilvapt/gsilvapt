:robot: Tech stuff:

- Software Developer with a focus on cyber security. Worked as fullstack developer in the past, now mostly building tools, CLIs and automation for a security team.
  
- I code in Python mostly, trying to shift to Go.
  
- Lover and contributor of open source software/communities.
  
- Despite not writing front-end code anymore, I coded in ReactJS a long time ago - when React 16 came out?

- Sometimes I write my own thoughts and experiences in [my website](https://gsilvapt.me) but I don't do it often - I should though! 

- If you want to reach out to me, you can do it on [Twitter](https://gsilvapt.me) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsilvapt/).

🧑‍🦱👋 The human part:

- Born and raised in Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹.
 
- I speak Portuguese and English.

- When I'm not coding or learning how to break into things, I care for:
  - Sports and Exercise (Brazillian Jiu-jitsu 🥋, Running/walks 🏃‍♂️).
  - Study (courses on a maryad of topics), reading books, listening to music, go to the beach (when the weatherman allows it).
